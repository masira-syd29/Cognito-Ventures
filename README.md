Cognito Ventures ðŸ¤–
AI Analyst for Startup Evaluation
Cognito Ventures is a web application that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence to provide in-depth analysis of startup ventures. By simply uploading a pitch deck (in PDF format) and providing a website URL, the application's AI analyst generates a comprehensive executive summary, providing key insights into the startup's problem, solution, business model, and more.

Features
PDF Analysis: Extracts text content directly from a startup's pitch deck.

Website Scraping: Scrapes and analyzes textual data from the startup's public website.

AI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes the Gemini API to intelligently process the extracted data and produce a structured, detailed summary.

Asynchronous Processing: Leverages a Celery task queue and a Redis broker to handle resource-intensive analysis in the background, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Scalable Backend: Designed to handle multiple analysis requests without blocking the main application.
